/**
 * LogEZ palette v6.0 "Neon Lab, root #73FF00" — dark-only (Owner directive, unchanged since launch).
 * v4.0 narrowed the palette to black, white and green only; v5.0 (2026-09-03) re-rooted that green
 * on `#CAFF00`; v6.0 (Owner directive, 2026-09-04) re-roots it again on [NeonGreen] = `#73FF00` — a
 * truer green (H≈93°) than v5.0's yellow-green. Every other green in the file — the two derived
 * accents, the muted warm-up tone, and the nine-step superset ramp — is rebuilt as a lightness/
 * saturation variant of that same hue rather than left pointing at v5.0's old hue, so "every green
 * in the app" still traces back to one root. Hierarchy is still carried by vibrancy and lightness
 * within green: the more vibrant/lighter, the more primary the thing wearing it. See
 * docs/adr/0007-root-green-73ff00.md for the full rationale and every contrast number (computed via
 * WCAG relative-luminance contrast and CIE76 deltaE, not picked by eye).
 *
 * v7.0 (Owner-requested redesign pass, 2026-09-12): [NeonGreen] itself re-roots again, to `#B6FF3C`
 * (H≈83°, L≈62% — lighter and a touch more yellow than v6.0's `#73FF00`), matching the accent color
 * from the Owner-approved redesign mockup. Unlike the v5.0→v6.0 transition, this is a partial re-root
 * so far: only [NeonGreen] itself has moved. [SpringGreen], [DeepGreen], [Warning500], and
 * [SupersetPalette] all still trace v6.0's H≈93° hue, not this new one -- v6.0's own "every green
 * traces to one root" invariant is currently broken and needs a follow-up pass (recompute each at
 * the new hue, preserving its own lightness/saturation offset from the root) once the new root
 * itself is confirmed. Flagged here rather than left implicit so a future reader doesn't assume the
 * whole palette already re-rooted just because this comment block did.

 * currently reuses [NeonGreen] via `colorScheme.primary`, the same color as every ordinary CTA and
 * active state — so hitting a lifetime PR looks identical to just tapping a button. A deliberate
 * off-hue break from the green ramp (H≈43°, amber/gold) reads as a real event rather than another
 * shade of the same accent, the same way the app already keeps [Danger500] off-hue on purpose for
 * destructive actions. 12.14:1 contrast on [Neutral950] (WCAG relative luminance, not eyeballed —
 * comfortably clears the same bar every other color in this file is held to).

/**
 * Superset group colors (PHASE2_PLAN.md §5.1.2) — indexed by `supersetGroup % SupersetPalette.size`.
 *
 * v6.0 rebuilds these as tints/shades of the v6.0 [NeonGreen] root hue (Owner directive, 2026-09-04:
 * every green in the app "falls under" the root — same standing rule v5.0 established). These have
 * one hard functional requirement — group A must be tellable from group B at badge size — so the
 * nine steps were derived by optimizing for *maximum minimum pairwise CIE deltaE* within a narrow
 * band around the root hue (88°-162°, yellow-green through spring-green, staying clear of both true
 * yellow and anything that reads as cyan), subject to every step clearing 4.5:1 on [Neutral950] and
 * every step reading as visibly distinct from the root itself (deltaE > 8 from `#73FF00`). Result:
 * worst pair deltaE 25.31 (v5.0 scored 28.77, v4.0 scored 30.4 — comparable separation each time).
 * Ordered lightest-first so lower group indices — the ones a typical routine actually uses — are
 * the most vibrant, matching the palette's own hierarchy rule.
