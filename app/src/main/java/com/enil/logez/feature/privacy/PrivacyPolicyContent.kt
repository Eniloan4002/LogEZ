/**
 * The one source of LogEZ's privacy policy (Play-readiness audit, 2026-09-25). The in-app screen
 * renders it, and [PrivacyPolicyHtml] renders the same document as the page hosted for Google Play.
 * Health Connect requires the hosted policy to be the same one users see in the app, and a unit
 * test fails whenever the committed `site/privacy/index.html` stops matching this file, so the two
 * cannot drift.
 *
 * Replaced a single string resource that opened "LogEZ does not collect any data", which Play's
 * definition contradicts (map tile requests leave the device), and that named no developer,
 * contact, effective date, retention or deletion route.
 *
 * English only, deliberately not in strings.xml: a legal text must say the same thing in the app
 * and on the web, and the app ships in English only. Change [EFFECTIVE_DATE] whenever the meaning
 * changes, and describe the change in that release's notes.
