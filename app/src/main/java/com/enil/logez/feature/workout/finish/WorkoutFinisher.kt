 * PHASE2_PLAN.md §5.1.8's save transaction, in the order the plan specifies:

 * structural updates → rebuild `personal_records` for affected exercises.
 *
 * The ordering is load-bearing, not stylistic: the PR rebuild reads stat sets through a query
 * that filters `status = 'COMPLETED'`, so it must run after the status flip or it would omit the
 * very session that triggered it; and it must run after the uncompleted-set purge or abandoned
 * sets would count toward records.
 *
 * All four steps share one [TransactionRunner] transaction. Room's `@Transaction` cannot span the
 * three DAOs involved, and a partial save is unrecoverable: once the workout is COMPLETED the
 * finish screen can never be reached again, so a routine update or PR rebuild lost to a crash or
 * a cancelled coroutine would stay lost.
