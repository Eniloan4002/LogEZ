/**
 * Backs the post-save workout summary: total volume, completed sets, total reps, duration,
 * targeted muscles, and one medal per PR achieved. Reads the already-`COMPLETED` workout — every
 * number here is derived from persisted rows, never from live logger state, so the screen always
 * shows exactly what was saved.
 *
 * Stat parity invariant: the share card never shows a stat the summary screen doesn't — both
 * surfaces render the same Duration/Volume/Sets/Reps/Distance values from this one UiState, so
 * adding a card stat means adding the matching screen cell (and vice versa).
